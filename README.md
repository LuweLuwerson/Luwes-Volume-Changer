## Overview
Luwe's Volume Changer is a Windows utility that allows you to control the volume and mute state of specific applications (such as Brave and Discord) or the currently focused application using customizable global hotkeys. It features a settings window and an on-screen overlay to display volume changes.

## Features
- **Per-application volume control:** Adjust volume or mute/unmute for 2 apps of your choosing (defaults to Brave and Discord), or any focused app.
- **Customizable hotkeys:** Set your own global hotkeys for volume up, down, and mute actions per app.
- **On-screen overlay:** Visual feedback for volume changes, including app icons and mute status.
- **System tray integration:** Access settings or quit the app from the tray icon.

## Default Hotkeys
| Action                | Brave                | Discord              | Focused App           |
